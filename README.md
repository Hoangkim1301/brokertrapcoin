Welcome to our hommie project gang gang bụt bụt dịt đao! This repository contains [brief description of the project].

## Setup Instructions

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

To ensure a consistent development environment, we use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hoangkim1301/brokertrapcoin.git
    cd brokertrapcoin
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (replace `<name_of_environment>` with your preferred name, ex: "myenv"):
- To avoid packages or dependencies be installed globally, please use virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv <name_of_environment>
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:


   
    **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     "<name_of_environment>\Scripts\activate"
     ```
   
    **On Unix or MacOS**:
     ```bash
     source <name_of_environment>/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing Django (inside of venv)

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. To install Django in your virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your virtual environment is activated. If it's not, you can activate it using the instructions provided in the "Setting Up the Virtual Environment" section.

2. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install Django using `pip`, the Python package installer. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install Django
    ```

3. Verify that Django was installed correctly by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m django --version
    ```

    This should display the version of Django that was installed.

4. Plsease skip this step if you are not project manager!!!

Remember to add Django to your `requirements.txt` file to ensure that it gets installed when setting up the project. You can do this by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, which will update your `requirements.txt` file with all the Python packages installed in your virtual environment, including their versions.
